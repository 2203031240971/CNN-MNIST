# CNN-MNIST
🚀 Just completed a new Deep Learning project!

I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, and this project helped me deeply understand how CNNs work — from convolution layers to pooling, activation functions, and model optimization.

🧠 What I learned:
• How convolution + pooling layers extract spatial features
• Importance of normalization & regularization
• Training on GPU for faster performance
• Visualizing loss & accuracy
• Improving model performance with tuning

🛠 Tech Used:
Python | TensorFlow/PyTorch | CNN | MNIST | Google Colab

📈 Model Performance:
Achieved high accuracy on test data with a clean, efficient architecture.

💡 This project strengthened my foundation in Computer Vision and is a solid step toward mastering deep learning architectures.

Excited to explore more AI projects ahead! 🚀
